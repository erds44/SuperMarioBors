Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20 minutes  
1. Instance variables in the class are easy to read.   
2. In the Initlialize method, clear is used for Dead Mario  
rest purpose, which is very clean.  
3. In Load Method, it keeps checking if objects are in the  
cemera boundary. If so, add them to the corresponding list,  
which is good. 
4. What is not easy to read is that there are too many info  
in the Initlialize mehtod, try to break them down into peices.
