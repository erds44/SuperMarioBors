Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 10  
Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:   
* Readable
	1. Good variable name and nested, good encapsulation.
	2. Put comment for each block of lists, so it's easy to find which part belongs to.
	3. Using many methods to break long code into small parts, easy to read.
	4. Using Polymorphism for constructing ObjectNode.

* Unreadable
	1. Unused name spaces.
	2. Using full name for all types of objects. Consider using a dictionary for saving space.
